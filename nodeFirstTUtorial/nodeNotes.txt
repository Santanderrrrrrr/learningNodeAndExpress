//accessed by just typing node into the terminal.
//read evaluate print loop
//Document and window does not exist. Use "global"
//exit by ctrl+c or ".exit"

//typing node along with the file name executes the script within the file.
//one can access files in different locations using th file paths.

//node has a property called process.argv which is an array.
//the first element of the array is the path to the executable file of the 
  node applocation
//The second element of the array is the path to the current working directory
//The current working directory can also be accessed through a node property
  called process.cwd()

//apart from properties such as process.cwd() and process.argv, node has modules such as
  fs which lets you make files and has multiple other functions. 
//It is not readilu available in scope, therefore, it must be required. 
//requiring is done as follows: 
    const fs = require('fs')
//one can then use fs' multiple different methods:
    fs.mkdirSync('createdFile')
