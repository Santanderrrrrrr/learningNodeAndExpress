//one can have files accessible in other files by exporting them
//claiming something for export purposes in done as follows:
    module.exports.candy = 'liquorice'
//when you require the export in a different file, you reach the property
  needed by simply using dot notations.

//A shorthand way of doing it is by simply stating "exports" and then attributing the 
  value name as follows:
    exports.candy = 'liquorice'

//it's possible to export an entire directory using the exports functionality

//using NPM:
    ///once you install a package, you simply need to require the package name
    ///to see what the package has to offer, you can use console.dir(packageName)
       and see the interactive list of the properties of the specified havascript object.
    ///a global package install ensures the package is available from every directory in your 
       computer.
    ///We set up package-json using the "npm init" command
    ///to access globally installed packages, we use "npm link <packageName>"
    ///once you have the package-json set up, you just need to run the "npm install"
       command and the node modules including the ones your project are dependent on 
       as stipulated in the package-json will be downloaded and installed.
    ///an example is the group chat application in this file directory. It was installed simply
       by running the 'npm install' line.
