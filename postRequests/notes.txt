//making post requests does not add to the url query string
//making post requests alters the fabric of the db.
//the request param has a property called "req.body" which contains key-value pairs of data submitted in the request body
  //by default the req.body is undefined and is only populated when using parsing middleware like express.json() or express.urlencoded()
  //an example would look as follows:
        const express = require('express')
        const app = express()

        app.use(express.json()) //for parsing application/json
        app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})) //for parsing request bodies as url encoded data
                                                      //the app.use, as earlier mentioned runs on all express
                                                        requests, regardless of whether they're post/get or otherwise
        
        app.post('/profile', function(req, res, next) {
            console.log(req.body)
            res.json(req.body)
        })
  //As you'd notice above, the app.post function takes the url as well as three parameters to a callback
